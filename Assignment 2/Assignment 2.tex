\section{Exercise 1}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The sentence $\theta$ encoding all information: \\

    The Queen knows the following: \\
    Alice knows Bob has a red hat. Alice knows Bob doesn't know it, and she knows the Queen knows this. Alice doesn't know her own hat. \\
    Bob knows Alice has a red hat. Bob knows Alice doesn't know it, and he knows the Queen knows this. Bob doesn't know his own hat. \\

    $\theta$ =
        $K_q (
        K_a (
            r_b \wedge
            \neg K_b (r_b \vee w_b) \wedge
            K_q ((r_a \vee r_w) \wedge (r_b \vee r_w))
        )
        \wedge \neg K_a (r_a \vee w_a)
        \wedge
        K_b (
            r_a \wedge
            \neg K_a (r_a \vee w_a) \wedge
            K_q ((r_a \vee r_w) \wedge (r_b \vee r_w))
        )
        \wedge \neg K_b (r_b \vee w_b)
        )$

    \item A representation of the situation model \textbf{M}: \\

    $\mathcal{A}$ = \{a, b, q\} the agents Alice, Bob, and the Queen \\
    $\Phi$ = $\{r_a, w_a, r_b, w_b\}$ written as WR for: a is white and b is red \\
