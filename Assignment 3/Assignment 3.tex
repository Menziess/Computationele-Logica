\section*{Exercise 1}

\textit{(a) Show the following equivalence:}
\begin{center}
    $K_a \varphi \Leftrightarrow B_a^{\neg \varphi} false$
\end{center}

Take $s \in W$ such that $s \models_M K_a \varphi$ \textbf{(1)}.

Because \textbf{(1)} and \textbf{(Knowledge)} for all $t \in s(a)$ it's true
that: $t \models_M \varphi$ \textbf{(2)}.

Eliminating any world or all worlds either results in a world from s(a), where $K_a \varphi$, or no worlds at all, so $false$. \\
% TODO: Nog niet af


\textit{(b) Prove semantically the equivalence claimed on Slide 24 of Lecture
Notes 4.2:}
\begin{center}
    $B_a \phi \Leftrightarrow \lozenge_a \square_a \phi$
\end{center}
where $\Diamond a \phi : \neg \square a \neg \phi$ is the dual modality to safe
belief $\square a$.

[ANSWER HERE]

\textit{(c) Prove (via a counterexample) that safe belief does NOT imply strong
belief; i.e. that}
\begin{center}
    $\square_a \varphi \nRightarrow Sb_a \varphi$
\end{center}

[ANSWER HERE]

\textbf{HINT}: The positive statements (a) and (b) need general proofs: you
need to show that, for every plausibility model and every sentence $\phi$, the
desired formula is true at all the worlds of that model. But the negative
statement (c) must be shown by giving a counterexample: construct some
plausibility model and find some sentence $\varphi$ for which the implication
fails to be true at some world of that model (which we can think of as the
“real world”).

\section*{Exercise 2}

% A virtual agent in a video game doesn’t know his current position in the
% virtual space, but all he cares is (a) whether or not he’s in a “Dangerous”
% zone (say, close to a dangerous monster).

% And (b) whether or not he’s close to his Target (say, a treasure). Let’s use
% the letter d to denote the sentence the agent is in a dangerous zone, and the
% letter t to denote the sentence the agent is close to the target.

% These possibilities are independent of each other, and the agent doesn’t know
% which is the case, so he cannot exclude any of the four possible cases d∧t,
% d∧¬t, ¬d∧t and ¬d∧¬t.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Write down a logical formula in the language of beliefs,
    knowledge and conditional beliefs to encode all the above assumptions.}
    \[
    % However, our agent believes both that he’s close to the target AND that
    % he’s NOT in a dangerous zone.
        B_a(t \wedge \neg d) \wedge
    % If he would learn that this belief is WRONG (i.e. that at least one of
    % his two beliefs is false), then he’d still believe (conditional on this
    % new information) that he is close to the target.
    %    B_a^{ \neg (t \wedge \neg d)} t \wedge % EERSTE POGING
    % But if he would learn instead that he’s far from (=NOT close to) the
    % target, then (conditional on this information) he’d keep his initial
    % belief that he’s NOT in a dangerous zone.
    %   B_a^{(\neg t)} \neg d % EERSTE POGING
        B_a^{(t \wedge d)} (t \wedge d) \wedge
        B_a^{(\neg t \wedge \neg d)} (\neg t \wedge \neg d) \wedge
        B_a^{(\neg t \wedge d)} (\neg t \wedge \neg d)
    \]

    \item \textit{Represent the agent’s beliefs (and conditional beliefs),
    using a plausibility model with four possible worlds. Specify the valuation
    (which atomic sentences of the two atomic sentences d and t are true at
    which worlds). Represent the agent’s plausibility relation on these worlds,
    by drawing arrows going from the less plausible worlds to the more plausible
    ones.}

    \item \textit{Suppose somebody who never lies tells our agent “You are
    close to the target if and only if you believe that you are in a dangerous
    zone.” Write down formally this sentence as a formula $\varphi$ in doxastic
    logic (using the atomic sentences).}

    $\varphi \coloneqq t_a^{(B_a d)} \wedge B_a d^{(t_a)}$

    \item \textit{Interpreting the above truthful announcement $!\varphi$ as an

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \item \textit{After the previous announcement, another truthful
    announcement is made: “You are in a dangerous zone if and only if you don’t
    believe that you are in a dangerous zone.” Write down formally this
    sentence as a formula $\psi$ in doxastic logic (using the atomic
    sentences).}

    $\psi \coloneqq d_a^{(B_a \neg d_a)} \wedge B_a \neg d_a^{(d_a)}$

    \item \textit{What is the real world? (In other words, answer the question:
    is the agent in a dangerous zone or not, and is he close to the target or
    not?) Justify your answer, by interpreting the announcement in the previous
    part as a new update $\neg \psi$ and representing the updated model.}

    The agent believes that it's most plausible that he's in a dangerous zone,
    if $\neg \psi$, the agent knows that if he believes this, he's not in a
    dangerous zone.
