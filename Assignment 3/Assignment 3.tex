\section*{Exercise 1}

\textit{(a) Show the following equivalence:}
\begin{center}
    $K_a \varphi \Leftrightarrow B_a^{\neg \varphi} false$
\end{center}

[ANSWER HERE]

\textit{(b) Prove semantically the equivalence claimed on Slide 24 of Lecture Notes 4.2:}
\begin{center}
    $B_a \phi \Leftrightarrow \lozenge_a \square_a \phi$
\end{center}
where $\Diamond a \phi : \neg \square a \neg \phi$ is the dual modality to safe
belief $\square a$.

[ANSWER HERE]

\textit{(c) Prove (via a counterexample) that safe belief does NOT imply strong belief; i.e. that}
\begin{center}
    $\square_a \varphi \nRightarrow Sb_a \varphi$
\end{center}

[ANSWER HERE]

\textbf{HINT}: The positive statements (a) and (b) need general proofs: you
need to show that, for every plausibility model and every sentence $\phi$, the
desired formula is true at all the worlds of that model. But the negative
statement (c) must be shown by giving a counterexample: construct some
plausibility model and find some sentence $\varphi$ for which the implication
fails to be true at some world of that model (which we can think of as the
“real world”).

\section*{Exercise 2}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Write down a logical formula in the language of beliefs,
    knowledge and conditional beliefs to encode all the above assumptions.}

    [ANSWER HERE]

    \item \textit{Represent the agent’s beliefs (and conditional beliefs),
    using a plausibility model with four possible worlds. Specify the valuation
    (which atomic sentences of the two atomic sentences d and t are true at
    which worlds). Represent the agent’s plausibility relation on these worlds,
    by drawing arrows going from the less plausible worlds to the more plausible
    ones.}

    [ANSWER HERE]

    \item \textit{Suppose somebody who never lies tells our agent “You are
    close to the target if and only if you believe that you are in a dangerous
    zone.” Write down formally this sentence as a formula $\varphi$ in doxastic
    logic (using the atomic sentences).}

    [ANSWER HERE]

    \item \textit{Interpreting the above truthful announcement $!\varphi$ as an
    update with the sentence $\varphi$ in the previous part, represent the
    updated model.}

    [ANSWER HERE]

    \item \textit{After the previous announcement, another truthful
    announcement is made: “You are in a dangerous zone if and only if you don’t
    believe that you are in a dangerous zone.” Write down formally this
    sentence as a formula $\psi$ in doxastic logic (using the atomic
    sentences).}

    [ANSWER HERE]

    \item \textit{What is the real world? (In other words, answer the question:
    is the agent in a dangerous zone or not, and is he close to the target or
    not?) Justify your answer, by interpreting the announcement in the previous
    part as a new update $\neg \psi$ and representing the updated model.}
