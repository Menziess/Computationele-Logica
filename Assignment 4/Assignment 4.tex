\section*{Exercise 1}
A robot is in a war zone. 
It doesn't know its location, but all it cares is whether or not there is a 
\textbf{mine} in front ($m$), and whether or not there is an \textbf{enemy} 
approaching ($e$).
The robot has two sensors, one detecting pieces of metal in the ground in 
front of the robot (to assess if there is a mine ahead), and another one 
detecting tiny vibrations in the ground (to assess if there is an enemy 
approaching). 
The robot \textit{trusts} its sensors to be reliable, but is aware that they 
might not be completely reliable: it is in principle possible that the sensors 
might malfunction (indicating mines/enemies when there are none, or vice-versa). 
But, in case the sensors malfunction, the robot considers as \textit{equally 
plausible} that \textit{only one} (either) of the sensors malfunctions than 
that \textit{both} sensors malfunction.

At the moment, the sensors don't indicate any mines or enemies. 
So the robot \textit{believes} there are none, although it doesn't know this 
for sure (since the sensors might malfunction).

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Represent the robot's belief-revision structure using a 
  single-agent plausibility model}, with four possible states, using the 
  atomic sentences $m$ for ``there is a mine in front of the robot'', and $e$ 
  for ``an enemy is approaching''. 
  Draw arrows going from the less plausible worlds to more plausible worlds 
  (according to the robot's plausibility relation). 
  In your drawing, you may skip the loops (since plausibility relations are 
  assumed to be reflexive) and the arrows that can be obtained by composing 
  other arrows (since plausibility relations are assumed to be transitive), 
  but be aware that they are there. 
  Also, be sure to use all the information given in the text above.

  \draw [black] (63.6,-14.6) circle (3);
  \draw [black] (22.5,-14.6) circle (3);

  \draw [black] (38.95,-14.6) -- (47.35,-14.6);

  \fill [black] (60.6,-14.6) -- (59.8,-14.1) -- (59.8,-15.1);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  \item Suppose now that the robot's sensors indicate some vibrations. 
  Assume that the robot \textit{strongly trusts} its sensors (though it 
  doesn't know for sure they are reliable), ans so interpret this event as a 
  radical upgrade $\Uparrow e$ of the robot's belief structure with the 
  sentence $e$. 
  \textit{Represent the robot's new belief structure (as a plausibility model) 
  after this upgrade}.

  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2]
  \tikzstyle{every node}+=[inner sep=0pt]
  \draw [black] (65.45,-11.7) circle (3);
  \draw (65.45,-11.7) node {$e$};
  \draw [black] (17.95,-11.7) circle (3);
  \draw (17.95,-11.7) node {$m$};
  \draw [black] (33.9,-11.7) circle (3);
  \draw [black] (49.2,-11.7) circle (3);
  \draw (49.2,-11.7) node {$m,\mbox{ }e$};
  \draw [black] (20.95,-11.7) -- (30.9,-11.7);
  \fill [black] (30.9,-11.7) -- (30.1,-11.2) -- (30.1,-12.2);
  \draw [black] (36.9,-11.7) -- (46.2,-11.7);

  \fill [black] (62.45,-11.7) -- (61.65,-11.2) -- (61.65,-12.2);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  \item \textit{Immediately after} the event in the previous part, the robot's 
  metal detector indicates the presence of a mine. 
  Again, assume the robot strongly trusts the reliability of its detector, and 
  so interpret this a new radical upgrade $\Uparrow m$ of the robot's belief 
  structure with a sentence $m$. 
  \textit{Represent the robot's new belief structure (as a plausibility model) 
  after this new upgrade}.

  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2]
  \tikzstyle{every node}+=[inner sep=0pt]
  \draw [black] (35.95,-22.9) circle (3);
  \draw (35.95,-22.9) node {$e$};
  \draw [black] (50.85,-22.9) circle (3);

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  \item \textit{Immediately after the previous two events}, the robot receives 
  a message from its controller, saying that: ``(\textit{Right now, your 
  vibration detector malfunctions, so)} \textbf{Whatever you currently believe 
  about the enemy (approaching or not) is false}.''
  
  \textit{Let us denote by $\varphi$ the sentence announced by the controller. 
  Write this sentence formally, and determine in which possible states it is 
  true.}

  $\varphi \coloneqq Be \rightarrow \neg e \wedge B\neg e \rightarrow e$

  This is true in states: 1 and 3.

  \item \textit{Assume that the controller is known to be infallible, and so
  that the robot performs an update with the announced sentence. Represent the
  robots’s new belief structure (as a plausibility model) after this update.
  What does the robot believe about e and m after the update?}

  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2]

  \fill [black] (47.85,-22.9) -- (47.05,-22.4) -- (47.05,-23.4);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  \item \textit{What would have been the final belief structure (plausibility
  model) of the robot if the above three events happened in a different order,
  namely: first the robot received the above message from the (infallible)
  controller, then its (strongly trusted) sensor indicated vibrations (hence
  enemies), and then its (strongly trusted) metal detector indicated a mine?}

  After the infallible controller message, and after the sensor indicated
  vibrations:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2]
  \tikzstyle{every node}+=[inner sep=0pt]
  \draw [black] (39.15,-22.9) circle (3);

  \fill [black] (36.15,-22.9) -- (35.35,-22.4) -- (35.35,-23.4);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  After the mine presence was detected:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2]
  \tikzstyle{every node}+=[inner sep=0pt]
  \draw [black] (39.15,-22.9) circle (3);

\section*{Exercise 2}
A covered coin is on the table, lying either Heads up (H) or Tails up (T).
There are two agents, Alice and Bob, and it is common knowledge that neither of
them can see the coin, but that for some reason they both believe that the coin
lies Tails up.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item \textit{Draw a multi-agent plausibility model M0 (with two agents, a
  for Alice and b for Bob, and atomic sentence H and T) to accurately represent
  all the information above.}

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  \item \textit{Some external referee publicly announces: “The coin lies Heads
  up”. It is common knowledge that: Bob strongly trusts the referee, but that
  Alice is neutral towards the referee (neither trusts nor distrusts him).}
